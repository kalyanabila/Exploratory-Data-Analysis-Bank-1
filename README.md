### Introduction
Customer churn is the term used in the banking sector tries to denote the movement of customers from one bank to another. In the banking industry, identifying probable churn customers has increased in its importance in the recent past. In banking domain, we define a churn customer as one who closes all his/her accounts and stops doing business with the bank. There are many reasons for a customer to close the account(s).

### Problem
- Number of customers leaving the bank among three countries in Europe (France, Germany and Spain)

### Goals
- Focus on targeting which customer is more likely to stay or leave the bank

### Dataset
- analyze a recent and large dataset from 10000 customers across France, Germany and Spain

### Conclusion
- Investigated the effect of gender as a customer demographic variable. The result shows as the same as research from Buckinx and Van den Poel (2005) and Clemes et al. (2010) who listed customer-related demographic variables (e.g., income, age, education, culture, and nationality).
- By selling additional products to customers we associate with them, thus increasing their loyalty (we have seen that more loyal customers are those who use at least two bank products).
- Clients who have longer tenure and deeper banking relationships with the target bank are less likely to churn. Result from Shirazi & Mohammadi (2018) support the argument.

### Recommendation
1. Banks can improve their marketing by focusing their efforts to persuade clients to stay in bank on certain demographic clients particularly female clients, Germany and France nationality.
2. The importance to supply the whole range of financial products so that a customer can fulfill all his financial needs within one and the same service provider. Moreover, customers and intermediaries can build valuable relationships through products and services that both satisfy customer needs and strengthen the companyâ€™s future market position.
